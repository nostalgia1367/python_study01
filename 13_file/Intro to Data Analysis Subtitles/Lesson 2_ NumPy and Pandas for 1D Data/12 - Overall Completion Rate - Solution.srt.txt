Before getting started on this function,
I'm going to think abouthow I would calculate the overallcompletion rate for a single country.
So let's say i have these two values fora female and male completion rate.
To get the overall completion rate,
I would add up these two values anddivide by two.
Sure enough, that looks like it worked.
Now because of Numpy'svectorized operations,
I can actually use this exactsame line of code for arrays.
To demonstrate that,
I'll show the results on these shorterarrays with data for only 20 countries.
First, if I add the two arrays together,
I get an array withthe sum of the female andmale completion rate for each country.
So each element inthe resulting array is the sumof the corresponding elementsfrom the two previous arrays.
I'll name this array total_array.
Then if I divide the total array by two,
I get an array where each elementis half of the correspondingelement from total array.
This is the result I wanted, soI'll scroll up and fill in my function.
So the code for this functionis return (female_completion +male_completion) / 2.
And just like when doingarithmetic on single numbers,
adding parentheses is important.
