Next, I want to talk about thedifference between + and += in NumPy.
Before I tell you whatthe difference is,
I want you to think about whatyou expect the difference to be.
Look at these two code snippets, whichare the same, except that one says a +=this array and
the other says a = a + this array.
For each code snippet, select whatyou think its output will be.
Your options are the array([1, 2,
3, 4]), the array([2, 3, 4, 5]),
or the code will produce an error.
If you're not sure you caneither take your best guess oryou can try it and see.
The important thing is not gettingthis right on the first try butthat you learn the answer for
the future.
