Now I'm going to give you another chanceto practice using vectorized operations.
One question you'll often wantto answer in data analysis is,
how does a single data point compareto the rest of the data points?For example, I mentioned that I'm
interested in how the employment rate inthe U.S. compares the the employmentrate in other countries.
Is it higher or lower than the average,
and by how much?The question isn't very well-defined,
butone typical way that people use toanswer it, is to convert each data pointto a number of standard
deviations away from the mean.
This is called standardizing the data.
For example, let's considerthe employment data we have for 2007.
The mean employment rate was 58.6%,
the standarddeviation was 10.5%, and the employmentrate in the United States was 62.3%.
Then the difference betweenthe United States employment, andthe mean employment rate was 3.7%.
This is equal to about 0.35standard deviations orabout a third of a standard deviation.
In Mexico on the other hand, the meanemployment rate in 2007 was 57.9%.
Thus for Mexico the differencebetween the employment rate andthe mean employment rate was -0.7%.
Note that I use a negative difference toindicate a value that's below the mean,
and a positive difference to indicatea value that's above the mean.
This translates to about 0.067standard deviations below the mean,
giving a standardizedscore of negative 0.067.
On the next screen,
I'd like you to write a function thattakes a numpy array as an input.
And the array could containany type of numerical data,
such as employment data for example.
Then I want you to returna standardized array,
where each data point has been replacedby the standardized data point.
