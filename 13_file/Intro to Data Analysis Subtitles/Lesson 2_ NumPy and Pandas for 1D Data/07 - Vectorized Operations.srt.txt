Another benefit of nomparies is thatthey support something called vectorizedoperations.
The name is taken from linear algebra.
But if you aren't familiar withlinear algebra, that's fine.
For the purposes of this discussion,
you can think of a vector asjust being a list of numbers.
So, for example, one, two three orfour, five, six would both be vectors.
Now in linear algebra you can addtwo vectors of the same length.
This is called vector addition.
Now if you were defining vectoraddition how would you define it?Specifically, if you were
to add these two vectorswhat would you expect the result to be?I've added some choices here.
There's no right orwrong answer to this question,
just select the one you would choose.
