To show you why Numpy andpandas are useful.
I'm going to revisit somecode from last lesson, andsee how it would look ifI wrote it using pandas.
This is the code to first take a CSV andread it into a list, andthen get the unique
accounts out of that list.
I'm running this code onthe daily engagement full file,
since that file is rather large, andpandas deals with large files nicely.
Now if I run the code to load the fileinto a CSV, it takes a little while andfinally it finished.
Now, we cut some of the loadingtime out of the video, butit took about one minute.
Then after that, getting the uniquestudents takes a little while as well.
In fact, this one is going to takeabout six seconds, and now we're done.
As you'll see in a minute,
when I use pandas,
the code will run much more quickly.
In fact, in pandas this will alsobe only three lines of code.
The first will be this import statement.
In the second, I'll read it in the fileusing pandas built-in read CSV function.
And, finally, I can specify that Iwant to look at the acct column.
And then use pandas built-in uniquefunction to get the unique accounts.
As you can see, pandas has a lot ofconvenient functions, like read CSV andunique, that previously
we had written ourselves.
Now of these three lines of code, theone that actually takes the longest forme is importing pandas, which takes
several seconds the first time I do it.
That is certainly very long forjust importing a library.
But it more than makes up for it withthe speed of the rest of the code.
After that, reading the data intothe CSV takes just a few seconds,
rather than the one minutethat I waited earlier.
And actually getting the unique accountsfinishes before I can even blink.
