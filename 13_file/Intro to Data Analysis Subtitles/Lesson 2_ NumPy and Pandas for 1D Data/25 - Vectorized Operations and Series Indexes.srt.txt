Series indexes have an interestingeffect on vectorized operations.
When you add two NumPy arrays,
you're adding up elements of the sameposition since there is no index.
Now, forthe series that you've added up sofar, the positions andindexes have been the same.
What do you think happensif that's not the case?And if you were to add based on index
rather than position, what do you thinkwould happen if you were to add up twoseries that had different indexes?
Try it out and see.
On the next screen you'll see code toadd a few different Pandas series withwith different indexes.
Take a look at the results andsee if you can figure out the pattern.
Once you have a theory about howvectorized operations work forPandas series, watch the solution
video to see if you are correct.
