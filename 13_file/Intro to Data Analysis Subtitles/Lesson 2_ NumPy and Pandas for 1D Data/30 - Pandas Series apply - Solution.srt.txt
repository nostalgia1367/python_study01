In order to write the reverse_namesfunction, I'm going to start offby writing a function that
reverses only a single name.
First I'll split the name on a space,
which should giveme a list containing the first name andthe last name separately.
Then I'll extract the first name andthe last name using split_name at 0 andsplit_name at 1.
And finally I'll return the last name,
followed by a comma anda space, followed by the first name.
Now before trying to apply myreverse_name function to the entireseries, I'll test it
out on a single value.
I'll use the iloc attribute to getthe name at position zero, andthen reverse that name.
And sure enough, the name Andre Agassihas been transformed to Agassi, Andre.
Now I can reverse all the namesusing the apply function.
Specifically, I'll return namesthat apply and all passes andargument the reverse name function.
And when I call reverse names Iget each of the names reversed andcollected in a panned series.
