Again, these are all reasonable answers.
The first, this is what Python does.
It creates a list with all the valuesfrom the original list repeatedthree times.
One, two, three.
The second is the behavior youget in both linear algebra andwith NumPy arrays.
The first element of the original vectorwas multiplied by 3 to get the firstelement of the result.
The second was also multiplied by 3 andthe third was multiplied by 3.
And again,
the third option is very common.
Many programming languages wouldnot allow you to multiply a list oran array by a number.
