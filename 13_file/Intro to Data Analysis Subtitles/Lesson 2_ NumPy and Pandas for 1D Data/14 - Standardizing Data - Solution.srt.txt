Again, I'll first think about howto standardize a single data point,
say the value at position zero.
First, I'll calculate the distanceof that value from the mean,
which I can do by subtracting.
Then to convert to a numberof standard deviations,
I'll need to divide bythe standard deviation.
And again,
parentheses are important here.
So this will calculatea single standardized value.
And I could use a loop tostandardize all the values, butinstead I'm going to usevectorized operations.
Again, vectorized operations make thecode to operate on an entire array verysimilar to the code that
operates on a single value.
I'll simply change thisvariable from a single valueto the entire array of values.
Now values is the entire array, andthe mean is still a single number.
So this subtraction subtracts the meanfrom each value in the array.
Then the standard deviationis still a single number, sothis division divides each element of
the array by the standard deviation.
And since this standardized all thevalues in the array, I will change thisvariable to standardized values,
and I'll delete this line.
And finally,
I will return the standardized values.
