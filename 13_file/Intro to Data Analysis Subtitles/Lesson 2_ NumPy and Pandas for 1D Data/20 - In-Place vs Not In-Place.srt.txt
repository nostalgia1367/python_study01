The answer to this question isa bit surprising or at least,
it surprised me when I first learned it.
Because Numpy arrays have differentbehavior than Python lists.
You start off with the variablea referring to the array 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
However, when you take a slice ofthe first three elements of the array a,
Numpy doesn't actuallycreate a new array.
Instead, slice refers to what'scalled a view of the original array.
It will look like a new array, butif you modify it,
the original array is modified as well.
This makes slicing a Numpy very fast,
since you don't have to createa new array or copy any new values.
But it means you should be verycareful any time you want to modifya slice of an array.
So the correct answer here is thatthe output is this second choice.
An array containing 100, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
