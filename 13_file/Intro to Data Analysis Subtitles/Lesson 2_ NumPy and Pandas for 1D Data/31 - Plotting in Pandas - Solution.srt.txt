We provided code for you to loadeach variable into something calleda data frame,
which you'll learn about next lesson.
Then this code extracted a seriesfrom each data frame corresponding tothe US only.
If you wanted to examine a countryother than the United States,
you could have changed this value.
Now, to make my plots,
I'll add the lines %pylab inline,
to make my plots appearwithin the iPython notebook.
But if youre not using iPython notebookyou wouldn't have added this line.
And then I can plot the employment inthe US by calling employment_us.plot.
Here, I can see that the years,
which are the indexes of the series,
have been filled in on the x-axis.
And the employment values havebeen filled in on the y-axis.
And the same code would work forthe other variables.
