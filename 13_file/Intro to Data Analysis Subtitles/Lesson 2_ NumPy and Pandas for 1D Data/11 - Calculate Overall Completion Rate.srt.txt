You might be wondering if you canadd two vectors, can you subtract,
multiply or divide two vectors?In NumPy the answer is yes.
You can vectorize almost any operation.
You can add two NumPy arrays with a plussign, subtract with a minus sign,
multiply with an asterisk,
divide with a slash andexponentiate with a double asterisk.
These operations all workwith two NumPy arrays.
Or with a numpy array anda single number.
You can also do logical operations.
If you have two arrays ofBooleans you can use ampersandto take the logical and.
And you can use this vertical barsymbol to take the logical or.
This is underneath the delete orbackspace key on most keyboards.
And finally you can use the tildeto take the logical not.
Which is on the topleft of most keyboards.
Now make sure your arrays containBooleans if you're going to performthese operations.
If your arrays have integers insteadthen these symbols will do somethinga bit surprising called bit wise and,
bit wise or, and bit wise not.
You can read about those operations inthe instructor notes if you're curious.
But it's not important for this course.
You can also use all the standardcomparison operations.
Now these vectorized operations makea lot of data analysis code super clean.
And they're also usually fasterthan doing the operations manually,
using a loop.
By the way, there's a cheat sheetavailable in the downloadable sectionthat will help you
remember these operations.
As well as a bunch of other commonbits of NumPy in Panda's code.
On the next screen, you'll have a chanceto test out some vectorized operationsand see how they work.
You'll also write a function that usesvectorized operations to calculatethe overall school completion
rate in each countryusing the female school completion rateand the male school completion rate.
To do this, assume that exactly half ofthe population in each country is male,
and half is female.
