In the last lesson, you did a bunchof data analysis using Python.
And you did use NumPy andmatplotlib a bit, but for the most part,
you completed the analysis withoutusing any additional libraries.
In this lesson, you're going to geta lot more familiar with NumPy.
And I'll also introduce youto a library called pandas.
Both of these libraries,
especially Pandas take a littletime to learn how to use.
But once you do, they'll make writingdata analysis code a lot easier.
And your code will also runfaster when you use them.
When I first started using Pandas,
I spent a lot of time reading onlinedocumentation, going through tutorialsand I found it really difficult.
This course contains the informationI wish I'd had when I started out.
I won't be able to cover every featurethat you might want to use, butby the end, you'll be better equipped
to read the documentation andlearn more on your own.
In this lesson, I'll be focusing onusing NumPy and Pandas to analyze onedimensional data, so something like
a single column of a spreadsheet.
