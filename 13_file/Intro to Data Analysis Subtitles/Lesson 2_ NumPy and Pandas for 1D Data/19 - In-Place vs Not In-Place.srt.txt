A common term for the behavioryou just saw is that plus equalsoperates in place while plus does not.
That is,
plus equals is storing all the newvalues in the same places the originalvalues were stored rather than
creating a new array to store them in.
Operations that are not in placecan be a lot easier to think about.
Like you just saw,
when you do in-place operations,
variables can be modified even when itdoesn't look like they will change,
such as the variable bin the previous example.
In this course we'll mostly be usingoperations that are not in-place.
I prefer to use just plus forvectorized addition, not plus equals.
Here's another place wherethis concept comes up.
Read through this code snippet, anddecide what you thinkthe output will be.
Again, if you're not sure, eithertry it out, or take your best guess.
