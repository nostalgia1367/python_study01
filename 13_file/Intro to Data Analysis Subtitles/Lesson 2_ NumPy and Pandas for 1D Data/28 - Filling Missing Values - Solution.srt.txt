Here's a query I use to try tofind the answer to this problem.
Pandas add two series without nans.
And it looks like the firstresult is about adding pandasseries with differentindices without getting nans.
That sounds like what I'm wondering.
The first answer on this pagesuggests using the fill value andsome sample code is provided.
In the example code,
I can see that the person who posted,
is advocating using the .add function,
instead of the +.
And then the .add function cantake an argument, fill_value=0.
So I'll try that outon these two series.
And it looks like the result isexactly what I was hoping for.
