The first code snippet will print 2,
3, 4, 5.
I haven't shown you the plusequals operation before, butit will modify the existing array.
So, before you run this line, both a andb will point to the same array whichcontains the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Running this line updatesthe values to 2, 3, 4 and 5.
So now if you print a or if you print b,
you'll see the same result,
the array 2, 3, 4, 5.
The second code snippet, on the otherhand, will print 1, 2, 3, 4.
Once again, a andb start off referring to the same array.
1, 2, 3, 4.
However, the plus operator withoutan equal sign first creates a new array.
The values in the new array are 2,
3, 4, and 5.
Then setting A equal to this new arrayupdates A to refer to the new array.
B still refers to the previousarray which has not been modified.
So when you print B youget the output 1, 2, 3, 4.
