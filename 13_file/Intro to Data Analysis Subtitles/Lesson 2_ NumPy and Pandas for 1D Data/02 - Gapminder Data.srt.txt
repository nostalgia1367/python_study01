Throughout this lesson, I'm goingto use examples from a new datasetwhich contains information about
employment levels, life expectancy, GDP,
and school completion ratesin various countries.
This data was collected by the siteGapminder which is linked inthe instructor notes.
In this lesson I won't be going throughthe data analysis process in order,
since I want to focus on how touse NumPy and Pandas effectively.
Instead you'll be doing a bunchof analysis on this dataset, butnot necessarily in order.
I still want you to start off bythinking of some questions though.
In the downloadable section thereis a file which explains whatdata is available in more detail.
Take a look at that file andtry to think of at least five questionsthat you could answer using this data.
Then share the questions you thought ofwith your classmates on the forums, andwhen you're done, check these boxes.
The csv files containing the actualdata are also available inthe downloadable section,
if you'd like to take a look.
But that shouldn't be necessarysince you'll be able to complete allthe programming exercises in this
lesson within the Udacity editor.
