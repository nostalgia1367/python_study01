Now these are all reasonable answers.
And in fact, they are all implementedby different programming languages.
This first one is vector additionas defined by linear algebra.
First, the first two numberswere added to get 5.
Then the second two were added to get 7.
And finally the last twowere added to get 9.
This is also the behavioryou get when you add two.
The second result is the result ofsomething called list concatenation, andthis is what adding two
lists does in Python.
A new list is created with allthe elements from the first listfollowed by all the elements
from the second list.
And the last option is very common.
Most languages do implementlist concatenation.
But in a lot of languagesyou call a function oruse some different symbolother than the plus sign.
So then using the plus sign with twoarrays or less would give you an error.
Since this first option is what Num Pydoes that's the option we'll be focusingon in this course.
