The first thing I want to dois create an array of booleansindicating whether each student
cancelled in the first week.
I'll call the array is_paid and it willcontain true for students who remainedenrolled for at least seven days before
cancelling and false for others.
I can create this arrayusing vectorized operationsby comparing the days_to_cancel
array to the value 7.
Then I'll create an arraycalled paid_time.
Which includes the time spent foreach student, butonly including paid students.
To keep only the paid students,
I'll us is paid as an indexarray into time spent.
Finally I'll take the mean ofthis array to get the mean timespent by paid students.
And this code could actually all besimplified down to a single line.
And again,
once you're used to index arrays andvectorized operations, I think thisline of code is very clear and concise.
It says look at the time spent foreach student, but only forstudents who stayed enrolled at
least seven days before cancelling.
And then take the mean of that time.
