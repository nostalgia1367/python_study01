Here are some questions I thoughtof that I'm interested in.
First, how has employmentin the US varied over time?Of course, you could ask the same
question about another country.
I'm particularly interested in the US,
because that's where I live.
But you may have another countryyou're interested in investigating.
In the most recent year we have data on,
what are the highest andlowest employment levelsout of all the countries?Which countries have
those employment levels?And where is the US on that spectrum?Of course,
I could ask these same questions forany of the other variablesin the data set, as well.
I'm also interested in whether there areany consistent trends across countries.
For example, have there beenany global recessions andif so, can I find them in this data?
Answering this last question would bea bit complicated and we're not goingto get into it in this lesson, but
we can definitely tackle the others.
