You just saw that NumPy functions likemean operate on the array as a whole butin many cases it might make sense to
calculate the operation by row orby column.
For example, consider the array ofsubway riders that you just looked at,
where each column is a station andeach row is a date.
It might make sense to take the meanridership per day across all subwaystations like you just did but you might
also want to take the mean ridership foreach station or for each date.
Most functions built into NumPy takean axis argument for this reason,
which can be either zero or one.
If the axis is zero,
then the function will be calculated foreach column and if the axis is one,
it will be calculated for each row.
I find it hard to remember whichaxis is zero and which is one so,
I always just try it out andsee before using the axis argument.
To get some practice, I want you towrite some code to find the meanridership per day for
each subway station.
Then, out of all the subway stations,
return the maximum andthe minimum ridership per day.
