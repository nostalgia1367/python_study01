In order to writethe standardized function,
I'm first going to write a function thatstandardizes one column of a DataFrame,
which I can then call on eachcolumn of the DataFrame.
I'll call the function that works ona single column, standardized_column.
And hopefully, the code in thisfunction looks familiar by now.
I'll test this function by calling it ona single column of the grades DataFrame.
And it looks good to me.
Then to standardize each column ofthe data frame, I'll call df.apply andpass in the standardized
column function.
When I try this out, I can see thatI got the same results as before forthe first column, and
the results for the secondcolumn have also been computed.
