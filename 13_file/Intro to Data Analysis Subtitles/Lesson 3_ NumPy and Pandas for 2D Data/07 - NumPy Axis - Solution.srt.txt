First, I want to find the mean ridershipper day for each subway station.
Since each station is a column,
I can do this using the meanfunction with an axis of 0.
Sure enough, that gave me five means.
One for each of the subwaystations in this array.
I'll call this array station riderssince it contains the ridership foreach station.
Next, I need to find both the maximumdaily ridership and the minimum.
I can find the maximum bytaking station_riders.max andthe minimum by takingstation_riders.min.
Next I'll move this code insideof my function, and again,
I don't need to changeany variable names.
And I'll return the max_daily_ridership,
and the min_daily_ridership.
Finally I'll run this functionon the example array.
It looks like the station withthe maximum riders per day had about3200 and the station with
the minimum had about 1,000.
The maximum is the same value that wesaw last time as the mean ridership forthe station with the maximum
on the first day.
Which indicates that the station inthis case that had the most riders onthe first day also had
the most riders overall.
The minimum is lower than the overallmean we saw before, which makes sense.
