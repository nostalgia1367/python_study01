Data frames also supportvectorized operations, andthey work similarly to vectorized
operations for 2D NumPy arrays.
Like pandaSeries, they match upelements by index and column name,
rather than by position.
On the next screen you'llget a chance to try out somedifferent vectorized operations and
see what they do.
There will also be an exercise foryou to get some practice.
The Subway data in its originalformat did not includethe hourly entries and exits.
Instead, it had cumulative ortotal entries and exits.
So, for example if the totalentries were 10, 40, 60,
65 and 85 for the first fivehours the station was open.
Then the hourly entries forthe first hour would be 10.
Again, assuming that this isthe first hour the station was open.
And the entries forthe next hour would be 30,
since 30 people joined to bringthe total from 10 up to 40.
And the rest of the hourlyvalues would be 20, 5, and 20.
We converted the total entries andexits into the hourly entries andexits that are available in the file
in the downloadable section.
In the following exercise you'll write afunction that takes in a data frame withcumulative entries in one column and
cumulative exits in a second column.
And then return the data framewith hourly entries and exits.
You might find the shiftfunction helpful.
Documentation for it is linkedin the instructor's notes butI recommend that you just try it out and
see what it does.
