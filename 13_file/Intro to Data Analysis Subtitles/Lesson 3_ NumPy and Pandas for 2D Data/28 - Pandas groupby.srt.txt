I decided to make a plot of subwayridership by day of the week.
The first thing I wanted to dowas take a look at the data andremind myself where that
information was stored.
And I can see here that it'sin the day_week column.
So the first thing I'm going todo is group the subway data bythe day of the week.
And as before, this gives mea data frame grouped by object soI can't really see what's going on yet.
Next, I want to take the meanridership for each day of the week, soI'll add .mean.
This time, I can see some results.
This is showing me the mean value ofeach column for each day of the week.
I'm specifically interested inthe ENTRIESn_hourly column, soI'll look at that one.
And then running this again, I seea series containing only the values forthe ENTRIESn_hourly column.
And I'll name thisseries ridership_by_day.
Next I'm ready to makea plot of these values.
As usual I'll use %pylab inline tomake sure the plots appear withinthe notebook and import seaborn as sns
to make my plots look a little nicer.
Next, I'll call ridership_by_day.plot.
And this is the plot I get.
The most striking I notice is thatthe ridership is significantlylower on days 5 and
6 than during the rest of the week.
Days 5 and 6 are Saturday andSunday, so this makes sense.
