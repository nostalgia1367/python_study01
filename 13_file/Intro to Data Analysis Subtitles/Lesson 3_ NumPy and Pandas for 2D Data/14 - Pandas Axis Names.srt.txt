Just like NumPy, many Panda'sfunctions also take an axis argument.
And you can use axis = 0 oraxis = 1, like for NumPy,
but you can also use axis = index oraxis = columns.
Now this sounds like it should makeit easier to remember which versionof the axis argument is which, but
it can actually be pretty confusing.
Taking the mean with axis equalscolumns will actually notgive the mean of each column.
Instead it gives the mean of each row.
The idea is that you are takingthe mean along the columns.
Similarly with axis = index, youare taking the mean along the index, orthe rows.
I still have trouble remembering whichway the axis argument will work, soagain I always try it out in iPython and
see what happens beforeI use the argument.
