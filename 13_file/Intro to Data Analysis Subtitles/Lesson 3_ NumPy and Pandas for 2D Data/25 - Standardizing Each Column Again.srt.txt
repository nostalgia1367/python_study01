Earlier this lesson you wrote codeto standardize each column ofthe data frame using apply.
Now using what you just learned,
I want to try the same thing again, butthis time without using apply.
Instead, use rectorized operations.
As an extra challenge, try standardizingeach row of the data frame instead.
Again, without using apply.
This one is tricky.
You might have to experiment fora while to get it to work.
