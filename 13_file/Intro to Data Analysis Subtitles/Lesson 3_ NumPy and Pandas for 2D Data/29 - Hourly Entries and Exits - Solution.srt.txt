I'll use the function I wrote earlieras a starting point since that will bethe code to calculate the hourly
entries and exits for a single group.
This time I've namedthe functionhourly_for_group.
Now the first thing I'll need to dois group the ridership_df by unit.
As usual this givesthe DataFrameGroupBy object.
Now it might seem logical to apply thehourly_for_group function at this point.
However, if I try this I geta message that says type error.
Unsupported operated types for minus.
String and string.
The reason this is happening is pandasis trying to apply the hourly forgroup function to each column of
the data frame, including the unit andtime columns.
Since these columns contain strings,
the function doesn't work on them.
You can't subtracta string from a string.
To fix this,
I need to select just the entries andexits columns,
before applying this function.
Once I've done that,
the function works as expected.
This time, I see two rows of NaNs,
one for each station.
That's because foreach station there was one row,
where there was no previousrow to compare it to.
