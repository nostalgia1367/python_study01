Just like for a pandas series,
you sometimes might want to perform somecomputation on a DataFrame that can'tbe done using built-in functions or
operations.
Similarly to a series,
you can write a function, let's say f,
that takes in a single element fromthe DataFrame and returns a new element.
Then you can applythat function f to eachelement of the original DataFramein order to get a new DataFrame.
For example, last lesson,
I wrote a function called clean_stateto take in a state that mightbe in one format or another, and
return it in a standardized format.
To call this function on eachelement of the DataFrame df,
you would call df.applymap(clean_state).
Now, why is thisfunction called applymapinstead of apply like it was for series?I think it's kind of unfortunate, but
you'll see in the next video that applydoes something slightly different forDataFrames.
In the next exercise, I want youto write a function that convertsnumerical grades to letter grades.
You'll be given a DataFramewhere each column is an exam,
each row is a student and each value isthe score that student got on that exam.
You should use the rule thata score of 90 or higher is an A,
80 or higher is a B, and so on.
Use applymap to create a new DataFrame,
where each numerical score hasbeen replaced by a letter grade.
