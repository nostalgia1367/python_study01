I’ll start out by taking a look at thefirst three rows of the two data framesI want to merge.
The first thing I'll need to decideis what to pass to the on keyword,
that is how to match up rows fromthe two different data frames.
It looks to me like I’ll wantto match up by date and hour,
latitude and longitude.
And so I'll call subway_df.merge,
weather_df.
And then the on keyword will bea list of those four fields.
I'll also need to decide whether howshould be inner, outer, left, or right,
and I've chosen inner, since I only wantrows that are present in both tables.
The result is a data frame withall the columns from both tables.
For example, the entries and exitscolumns are from the subway data, andthe fog and pressure columns
are from the weather data.
They've been matched up by date,
hour, latitude and longitude.
Now one thing that was convenient hereis that the four columns I wanted tomerge on have the same
name in both data frames.
What would I do ifthat weren't the case?For example, what would I do ifthe date column were called DATEn
in the subway data and lowercasedate with no n in the weather data?Because of this, Pandas allows
you to specify the left_on,
meaning the columns for the left tableand the right on meaning the columns forthe right table separately.
For the left on,
the columns will be the same as before.
And for the right on, the columns willbe the same but with the other name forthe date column.
And this code should givethe same results as before.
