There's also another possible way touse the apply function for data frames.
Instead of taking in one column andreturning a new column,
the function f could take in onecolumn and return just a single value.
In this case,
instead of creating a new data frame,
apply will create a new series.
Where each column of the data framehas been reduced to a single value.
For example, if I wanted to findthe maximum value in each column,
I could call, df.apply(np.max) tocall NumPy's max function oneach column of the data frame.
This would give me the same result, it'scalled the built-in function df.max.
So in this case using the built-infunction would be simpler.
But as usual apply can be usefulwhen there's not a built-infunction that does what you want.
For example what if you wanted to findthe second largest value in each column?In that case it would make sense
to use the apply function.
In the next exercise,
I want you to do just that.
