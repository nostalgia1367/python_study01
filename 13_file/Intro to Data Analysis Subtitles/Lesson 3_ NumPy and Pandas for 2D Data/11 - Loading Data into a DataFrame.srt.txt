A data frame is a particularly good datastructure to represent the contents ofa CSV file.
It's a two-dimensional datastructure with a different type foreach column, which is often
exactly what you want for a CSV.
Pandas has a function called read_csv,
which takes in the file name of a CSVfile and loads it into a data frame.
I'll use this to load in the New Yorksubway and weather data.
Since there is a lot of data I don'twant to print out the entire data framelike I've done before.
Instead, I'll use the head function toprint out just the first five lines.
The head function returnsa smaller data frame sothe results display justlike a small data frame.
I can also use the describe function tosee some statistics about each columnlike the mean and
the standard deviation.
You got a preview of the read CSBfunction at the end of the last lesson.
It was used by the starter codethat loaded in the gap minderdataset for you.
