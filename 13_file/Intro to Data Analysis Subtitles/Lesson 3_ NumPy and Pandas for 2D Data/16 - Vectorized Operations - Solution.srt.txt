I mentioned that the shiftfunction might be helpful.
So I'll start off by lookingat the documentation for that.
The documentation says that the functionwill shift the index by the desirednumber of periods with
an optional time frequency.
Now that seems pretty cryptic to me.
So, I'm just going to try the functionout and see what it does.
One thing I do see here,
is that the shift function needs totake an argument called periods,
which is an integer indicatingthe number of periods to move.
So, I'll try shifting the exampleentries and exits data frame andto start off with, I'll shift with
a number of periods equal to one.
When I try this out,
it looks like the first row ofthe resulting DataFrame contains NaNs.
The second row corresponds to the firstrow of the original DataFrame,
the third row corresponds tothe second row, and so on.
Just to make sure I understand, I'vealso run this function with the argument2, and
this time the first two rows are NaNs.
And the third row of the resulting dataframe corresponds to the first row ofthe original data frame.
To calculate the hourly entries andexits, I want to take each value inthe data frame and subtract
the value from the previous row,
which I can do using vectorizedoperations and the shift function.
Here I've taken each value inthe data frame and subtracted,
that dataframe shifted by one,
which will give me the previous row.
When I run this functionon the example dataframe,
I get the following output,
which looks reasonable.
One odd thing is that the firstrow contains NaNs, butwhen you think about it,
this makes sense.
Because for the first row in the dataframe, you dont know how many hourlyentries and exits there were, since
there's no previous row to compare to.
It might make sense though to drop thisrow or replace these values with zero.
