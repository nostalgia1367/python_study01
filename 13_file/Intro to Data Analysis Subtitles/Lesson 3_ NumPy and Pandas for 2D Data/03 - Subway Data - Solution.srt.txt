Here are some questions I thought of.
In general, I'm interested in whatvariables are related to higher orlower subway ridership.
If I were working forthe New York Subway,
this information might be useful whenscheduling how many trains to run.
But since I don't I'm just curious.
There are several variables thatcould be related to subway ridership.
For example,
which stations have the most riders andhow dramatic is the difference?I'd also like to know what are the
ridership patterns like over time?Will I be able to see rush hour effects?How will weekdays and weekends differ?
This data includes the month of May,
which includes Memorial Day, soI wonder whether Memorial Day ridershipwill be similar to weekend days?
I could also look at how the weatheraffects subway ridership.
Do more or fewer people ridethe subway when it's raining,
when it's hotter out, etc.
I could also investigate weatherpatterns in New York independently ofthe subway.
For example,
since May comes before the summer,
is the weather systematically gettinghotter and hotter throughout the month?And how does the weather
vary across the city?Hopefully your excited toanswer some of these questions.
Lets get started.
