Just like last lesson, you'll beable to complete all the programmingexercises for
this lesson on the Udacity website.
But the data is available in thedownloadable section in case you'd liketo explore it further.
Again, I'll be focusing on NumPy andPanda's rather than going throughthe data analysis process in order.
But I still want you tostart by asking questions.
So download the description of the datafrom the downloadable section,
then think of at least five questionsyou could answer with this data andshare them on the forums.
When you're finished, check these boxes.
