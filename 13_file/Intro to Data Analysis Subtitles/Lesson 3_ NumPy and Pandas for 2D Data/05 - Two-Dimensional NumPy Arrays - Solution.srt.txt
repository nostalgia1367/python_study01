First, I'm going to write code that willwork on this small example array, sothat I can see whether it's
working at every step.
Then when I'm finished, I'll turn itinto this function, mean riders formax station.
The first step is to find the stationwith the maximum riders onthe first day.
The first day is row 0 of the array,
which I can get by passing 0 as the rowposition, and colon, meaning all ofthe columns, as the column position.
And I"ll check that that worked andsure enough, the first row was printed.
Now to find the maximum value,
I would find the .max function.
What I actually need is the stationthat had the maximum value.
To get that,
I'll use the arg max function,
which will return the positionof the maximum value.
Taking a a look,
I can see it was position 3.
And sure enough, column 3 inthe array has the maximum value.
I'll name this value max_station.
Next I want to find the meanriders per day for that station.
First I want to get the ridershipdata for that station, soI'll select all rows, and
the max_station column.
And I'll take a look, and sure enough,
that gives the correct columnof the ridership data.
Next I'll take the mean of those values.
And I'll call it mean_for_max, meaningthe mean value for the max station.
Finally, I need to findthe overall mean for comparison.
I can do that by simplytaking ridership.mean.
Now I'm ready to move thiscode inside of my function.
Since the example array and the argumentto the function have the same name,
ridership, I don't needto rename anything.
And I'll return both values.
Next I'll call this functionon the example array.
It looks like the overall meanwas about 2300 and the mean forthe max station was about 3200.
So the station with the higherridership on the first dayalso had a higher ridership
overall than the average.
Of course, that doesn't mean it hasthe maximum overall ridership out ofany station, but you'll calculate
that in the next exercise.
