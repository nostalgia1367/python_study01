Now I want you to calculate some metrics you're interested in for both groups of students. 
Students who pass the subway project and students who don't. 
For example, a good starting point would be the three that we looked at earlier. 
The number of minutes students spend in the classroom, the number of lessons they complete, and the number of 
days that they visit the classroom. 
Try to think of some other things to look at as well, though. 
You might look at whether these students are more likely to go on to complete other projects. 
Or you might try looking at some of the more granular data in daily_engagement_full.csv, and see if 
there's anything you can do with that. 
Be creative here. 
There's a lot available in this data that you could explore. 
Do the results surprise you? Do you notice anything interesting about them? Choose the metric where you think the 
difference is the most interesting, and share what you found on the forums. 
Also select which metric you shared here and enter the mean for students who pass 
in this box and the mean for students who don't pass in this box. 
If your most interesting finding was non-numerical, 
you can leave these boxes blank. 
I'm hoping you came up with your own idea for something to explore and that you'll check the other box, but you 
might also want to enter your value for say minutes spent to check that your code is working correctly. 
Also check this box once you've posted on the forums.
