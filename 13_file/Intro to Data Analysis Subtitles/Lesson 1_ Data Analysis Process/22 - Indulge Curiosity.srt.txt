Based on the question I want to answer. 
At this point the next task that would make sense for me to do is to split the data into two groups. 
Data for students who eventually pass the first project and for students who don't. 
But I have all this data about students' engagement in the first week, and I'm getting curious. 
I want to take a look at it. 
My rule of thumb is when I'm curious about my data, I investigate. 
Getting a better sense of your data is almost always useful. 
In this case, 
I'll probably be able to reuse some of the code I'm writing later. 
But even if that weren't true, exploring your data is never a waste of time for a data analyst.
