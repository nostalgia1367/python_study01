Now adapt the code I just showed you to analyze the number of lessons the students complete in their 
first week instead of the number of minutes they spend. 
Like I did, calculate the mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, and enter your numbers in these boxes to two decimal places. 
See if you can write one or more functions to reuse the code I wrote rather than copying and pasting it.
