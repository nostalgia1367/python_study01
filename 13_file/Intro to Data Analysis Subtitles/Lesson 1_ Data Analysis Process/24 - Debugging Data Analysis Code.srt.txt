So I just noticed that the maximum number of minutes spent by any student during the first week is 
actually greater than the number of minutes in a week. 
My process for debugging problems like this is similar to my process tracking down the missing 
engagement records before. 
I'd like you to follow the same steps here. 
First, you'll need to decide which data points count as surprising. 
Then, print some of those out and see if you can find anything wrong. 
Were you able to find a problem? Describe any problems you found here. 
The bug is actually in some of the starter code that I gave you. 
So if you can't figure out exactly what's causing any problems that you find, don't feel bad.
