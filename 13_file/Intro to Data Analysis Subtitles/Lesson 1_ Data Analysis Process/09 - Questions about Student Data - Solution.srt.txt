There's a lot of interesting questions we could answer. 
Besides the questions I already mentioned, we could look at how much time the average student spends 
taking classes on Udacity. 
We could look how time spent relates to the number of lessons or projects students complete. 
We could look at how student engagement changes over time. 
Or how many times students submit projects before they pass and whether this differs for 
different projects. 
I'm sure you thought of a lot of interesting questions as well. 
In this lesson, I'm going to focus on how the numbers in the daily engagement table differ for students who pass their 
first project versus students who don't. 
But feel free to explore any of the other questions you've thought of yourself and 
share what you find on the forums.
