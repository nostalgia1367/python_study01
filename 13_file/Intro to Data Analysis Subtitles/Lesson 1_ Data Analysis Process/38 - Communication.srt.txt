After drawing conclusions and thinking predictions, 
the final step of the process is to communicate your findings. 
Now, even though you don't have rigorous conclusions backed by statistics or machine learning, you can certainly 
think about how to communicate the results of your exploration. 
At this stage, 
you generally want to decide which of your findings you think are most interesting or most worth sharing, and 
how you want to present those findings. 
For example, I was interested in the difference in total minutes spent in the classroom between students 
who passed the first project and students who didn't. 
And I think the clearest way to present this is simply to present the means for both groups. 
I also thought the difference in number of days visited in the first week was interesting. 
And then this case, 
I thought the histograms did a better job of showing back numbers. 
If you do want to share any visualizations, 
in general it's a good idea to spend some time polishing them. 
You want to make them look nicer and explain what trends you'll noticing in them. 
You always know what you made a plot of, 
but your reader doesn't.
