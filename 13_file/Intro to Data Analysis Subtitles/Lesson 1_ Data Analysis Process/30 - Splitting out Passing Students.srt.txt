Now find the point marked number 11 in your starter notebook and split the daily engagement 
data into two lists. 
The first list should contain the engagement data for students who eventually passed the first project, and 
you should name this list passing engagement. 
The second should contain records for students who don't eventually pass the first project, and you should 
name this list non-passing engagement. 
Throughout most of the time that this data was being collected, the first nano degree project was analyzing New York 
subway data, so that's the project that you're going to assume is the first project for this purpose. 
Now this project was actually updated at some point and the key identifying it changed, 
so I've given you both keys here. 
You should consider a student to have passed the first project if they ever pass a project with 
either of these two keys. 
As a reminder, here's what the project submission data looks like. 
You can use the lesson_key field to see which project was submitted, and you can use the assigned_rating field to see 
whether the student passed the project. 
The table descriptions file available in the downloadable section lists the possible values for 
the assigned rating field. 
Once you're finished, find how many engagement records correspond to students who passed the first 
project and how many correspond to students who didn't, and enter your number in the boxes on the next screen.
