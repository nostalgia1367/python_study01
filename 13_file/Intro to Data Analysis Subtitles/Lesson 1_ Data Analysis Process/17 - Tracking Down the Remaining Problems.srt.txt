At this point, since their were only three remaining problematic enrollments, 
I printed out all of them. 
However, this time when I looked at the records, 
I wasn't really sure what the problem was. 
I ended up asking a Udacity data scientist if he knew what was going wrong. 
He pointed out that these students were all Udacity test accounts. 
Which he could tell because they had is Udaucity equal to true. 
These test accounts aren't guaranteed to be present in the daily engagement table. 
This is really good to know. 
I should also probably be excluding any test accounts from my analysis anyway. 
At this point, there weren't any more surprising data points. 
I did go ahead and move all of the Udacity test accounts from the data right away since I didn't plan to 
include them in any future analysis. 
First, I created a set of all the Udacity test accounts by looping over the enrollment data, and I found that 
there were six of them in this data set. 
Then I wrote a function to remove any data associated with those accounts. 
Finally, I called my function on all three of my tables and checked how many records 
were left in each. 
Most of the data is still included, 
which is what I expected. 
I did create new variables for the updated data, just in case I ever want to look at the original data again.
