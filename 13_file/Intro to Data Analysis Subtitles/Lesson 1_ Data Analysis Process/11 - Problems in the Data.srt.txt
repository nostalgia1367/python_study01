Now I noticed a couple problems when looking at the data. 
The first thing I'm wondering is why were there more unique students in the enrollment table than 
in the engagement table? The engagement table is supposed to include a row for each day that each 
student is enrolled, even if the student didn't visit the site at all that day. 
So there should have been the same number of unique students in both tables. 
The second problem was that the column containing student account keys was named account_key in two of 
the tables and acct in the third. 
This one isn't really a big problem but it is inconvenient. 
I kind of expect to keep forgetting which table has account_key and which table has acct. 
The first problem is confusing. 
When I first started analyzing this data, I didn't know how to fix it. 
I didn't even know why it had happened. 
We'll investigate this together in a minute. 
Fixing the second problem is easier. 
You can simply the column name from acct to acount_key by removing the value for 
acct from each row and adding it back under the name account_key. 
Go ahead and write code to fix the problem. 
Once you're done, check whether your code worked by running this command, and enter the output in this box. 
If you prefer to create a new variable rather than modifying the existing variable, 
then use your new variable name in place of daily_engagement in this command. 
If you're not sure how to remove an element from a dictionary, 
the post in the instructor notes might be helpful.
