Now that we've fixed a few problems in the Udacity student data, 
and started to uncover some relationships between the variables, 
it's time to move on to drawing conclusions, or making predictions. 
You've probably already started to draw some tentative conclusions. 
For example, that students who pass the subway project spend more minutes in the classroom during their first 
week than students who don't. 
However, even if there was no real difference between students who passed their project than students who didn't, 
you wouldn't expect the two means to be exactly equal. 
How can you tell the difference you saw is a true difference or if it's due to noise in the data? 
The differences we saw looked pretty large so it may be hard to imagine this could be due to noise but 
intuition does not always work very well in these situations. 
To rigorously check how likely it would be to see these results by random chance, you need to use statistics. 
To learn more about how to do this, 
check out Udacity statistics course linked in the instructor notes. 
For now we're not going to go further in this direction since statistics isn't required to take this course, but 
keep in mind that the results we have are only tentative. 
They haven't been validated.
