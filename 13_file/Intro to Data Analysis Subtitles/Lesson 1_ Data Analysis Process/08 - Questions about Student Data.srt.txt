Now that you've loaded the student data into Python, 
I want you to think about what questions you could answer with this data. 
For example, you could figure out how long it usually takes students before the submit their projects. 
Or you could look at some different characteristic of students and try to find differences between 
students who pass their projects and students who don't. 
This is a great time to let your curiosity run wild. 
There's a lot of really interesting stuff you can figure out with this data and you're about to do it. 
So, start brain storming. 
Take another look at what data is available and try to think of at least 5 questions 
you could answer using it. 
Share your thoughts with your classmates on the forums.
