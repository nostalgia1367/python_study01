I'm going to show you the process I went through to solve this problem. 
You can also find the final version of my code in the instructor notes in case you'd like to take a closer look. 
The code should look pretty similar for each file. 
So first I'm going to copy the codes that I used before. 
Then I'll paste the code twice, and I'll need to change the file names into the variable names. 
So this should be doing engagement.csv, 
this should be projectsubmissions.csv, 
I'll name this variable daily engagement and this one one project submissions. 
Then I'll go ahead and print out one row of each and since I want to print just one row in 
the cell, I've used print statements. 
This worked, but anytime you find yourself copying and pasting code or just writing two pieces of 
code that are very similar, 
it might be a good idea to write a function instead. 
That way, if you find a bug later, 
you'll only have to fix it in one place. 
In this case, the only thing that changed between these three blocks of code was the file name and 
the variable name. 
So I'm going to write a function named read_csv that takes the file name as an input and 
then returns the list of rows. 
I'll use this code that I've already written as my starting point. 
Then instead of the file name here, 
I'll use the input that I took and instead of creating a variable, 
I'll return the list. 
Now I can delete these two blocks. 
And call the function three times. 
Now I'll run the code again just to check that it still works. 
Since this function is so short, it's debatable whether writing it was helpful. 
But I'm happy I wrote it. 
For example, if I hadn't realized I needed to open the file with the argument rb, and 
then later I noticed that I needed it. 
I could have updated this function, 
rather than updating the code in three separate places.
