So why are some students missing from the daily engagement table? When you see something 
strange like this, 
it can be tempting to just move on with the analysis. 
But it's actually really important to investigate things like this. 
If you don't understand why something's happening in your data, 
you could be missing something important in your analysis, and you can't really trust your results. 
The process I like to use to investigate this type of problem is, 
first, identify which specific data points are surprising. 
In this case, 
that would be any enrollment record with no corresponding engagement data. 
Next, I like to print out one or a few of the surprising data points. 
Sometimes I can tell just by looking what the problem is. 
So go ahead and do that. 
Find any one row in the enrollment table where that student is not present in the engagement table, 
and print that row out. 
If you're not sure how to print only one of the rows, 
you could try using Python's break statement. 
There's a link describing it in the instructor notes. 
And, here's a hint. 
The sets I made earlier containing the unique students in each table might come in handy here. 
Do you see anything strange about the record you printed? Describe what you see here.
