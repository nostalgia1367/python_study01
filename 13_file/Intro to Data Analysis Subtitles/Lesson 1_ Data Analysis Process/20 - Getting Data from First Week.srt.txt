Now I'd like you to find the point in the starter notebook marked 7, 
and create a list of rows that includes only some of the records from the engagement table. 
Specifically, you should include rows where the student is one of the paid students you just found, and 
the date is within one week of the student's join date. 
Give your new list the variable name paid_engagement_in_first_week. 
I've created this function you can use to determine if one date is within one week of another. 
Take a look at the number of engagement records that are present in your new list and enter your number in 
the box on the next screen.
