Thanks for sharing your findings. 
I can't wait to see what discoveries you've made. 
I wanted to improve the histograms showing the number of days students visit the classroom during 
their first week, for both passing and non-passing students. 
So I started off with the same plotting code that I had used previously. 
Then I added the line, 
import seaborn as sns. 
To the top of the first cell, since importing seaborn will automatically make the plots look a little nicer. 
You can see the difference here. 
The colors are a little bit better and there's a grid in the background. 
Next, I wanted to use the bins argument to specify that there should be exactly eight bins for this histogram. 
This will fix those blank spots that we saw earlier. 
There should be eight bins since there are eight possibilities for the number of days you visit the classroom in 
the first week, 0 through 7 inclusive. 
I also used plt.xlabel to specify that the x access was measuring number of days. 
And I used plt.title to add a title that would explain what the graph was showing to someone 
who didn't already know. 
Re-running the cell, I can see that the strange gaps have disappeared and my axis label and title have been added. 
Then I made very similar changes to the second histogram adding an xlabel, 
a title and setting the number of bins to eight. 
I didn't re-import Seaborn since that's not necessary. 
Seaborn will apply to all plots that are made from now on. 
And again I can see that all the weird gaps are gone and my x label and my title have been added.
