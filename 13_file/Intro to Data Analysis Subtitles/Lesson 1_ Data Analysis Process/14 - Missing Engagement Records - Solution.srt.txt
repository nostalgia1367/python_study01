The data point I saw was this one, 
although depending on your code, 
you might have seen a different one. 
If you couldn't figure out what was wrong with the data point, that's okay. 
Sometimes a little more investigation will be necessary. 
But I happened to notice that the join_date and the_cancel date are the same and 
the days_to_cancel is equal to 0. 
That could definitely explain why there is no record in the engagement table for 
this student. 
The student probably needs to be enrolled for a full day before their engagement is recorded. 
In order to find this record, 
I looped over the enrollment table and found the account key for each enrollment. 
Then I checked whether that account key was in the set of unique students in the engagement 
table that I had found earlier. 
If the student was missing from the engagement table, 
I printed the record and then used break to exit the loop.
