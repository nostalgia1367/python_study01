Once you've looked at some of the surprising points, 
it's time to fix any problems that you find. 
Of course, you won't always see the problem at first glance so more investigation may be necessary. 
Often though, you will find a problem or two just by looking at some of the surprising points, or you might find 
that there actually wasn't even a problem in the first place. 
In this case, I saw that a student had cancelled within one day of joining, 
and that's not really a problem, and it does explain why that student was missing from the engagement table. 
This is a good thing to be aware of, 
though. 
Depending on the analysis I do later, 
I might want to exclude students like this, or I might just need to know these students exist in case they 
cause an edge case in my code. 
At this point, the process repeats. 
Once again, I need to identify any remaining surprising data points. 
Of course there might not be any more surprises at this point, since a student who cancels the same day as they 
joined no longer counts as surprising. 
But it's still important to check in case there are other problems I haven't found yet. 
Go ahead and figure out whether there are any surprising enrollment records left. 
That is, rows in the enrollment table where the student is missing from the engagement table but 
they stayed enrolled, at least a day. 
Enter the number of surprising records you find in this box. 
It could be zero.
