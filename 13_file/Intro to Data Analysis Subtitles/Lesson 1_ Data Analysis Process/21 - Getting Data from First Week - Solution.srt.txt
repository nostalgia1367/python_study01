To solve this I first start a function to remove any data points corresponding to students who canceled 
during the free trial. 
Next I called this function on each of the three tables and saved the results in new variables. 
I also took a look at the length of these variables to see how much data had been removed. 
Next, I started off the variable paid_engagement_in_first_week as the empty list. 
Then I looped over each record in the engagement table and saved the student's account 
key in this variable. 
I also looked up the student's join date by using the dictionary I created earlier. 
And I saved the data of the engagement record into this variable. 
Next, I checked whether the two dates were within one week of each other. 
And if so, I appended this record to the variable paid_engagement_in_first_week. 
Finally, I printed out how many records there were, and you can see that about 21,000 of the engagement records 
come from the students' first week.
