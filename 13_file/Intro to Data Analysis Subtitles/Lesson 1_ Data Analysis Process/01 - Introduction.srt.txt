Hi, and welcome to Introduction to Data Analysis. 
I'm Caroline and I'll be your instructor for the course. 
Now a data analyst is someone who uses data to answer questions, and that's exactly what you'll 
be doing in this course. 
You'll tackle questions like what makes students more likely to submit their projects, or what countries 
around the world have the highest and lowest employment rates, and how does the country you live in compare? 
Or how the subway ridership varied by location, time of day and weather conditions, and many more. 
For each data set you'll have the chance to pose your own questions and perform your own investigations. 
Along the way you'll learn to use some libraries that make data analysis a lot easier. 
Specifically, you'll work with NumPy, 
Pandas and Matplotlib. 
But you'll start off analyzing data using pure Python. 
Now you won't need any experience with data analysis in order to take this course. 
But you will need to be comfortable programming in Python. 
You should be familiar with things like loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, 
objects, and things like that. 
If you need to learn more about any of those topics, 
check out the links in the instructor notes. 
Now let's get started.
