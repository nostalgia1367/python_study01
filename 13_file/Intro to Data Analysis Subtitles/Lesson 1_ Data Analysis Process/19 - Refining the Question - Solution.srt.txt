I'll start off by creating an empty dictionary. 
Then, I'll loop through the enrollments and notice here that I'm using the new enrollments variable I created, 
which doesn't include the audacity test accounts. 
I want to add the student to the dictionary if they haven't cancelled yet or if it was at least seven 
days before they did cancel. 
Then I'll pull out the account, 
cancel the enrollment date and save those in variables. 
And I'll add those to the dictionary with the account_key as the key and the enrollment_date as the value. 
Then I'll use the line function to see how many students this is and it comes out to 995. 
Now this works, but there's something a little strange about it. 
Earlier we saw that the same student can enroll multiple times and if that happens, 
then I'm just going to be saving an arbitrary one of those enrollment dates. 
Instead, I think it makes sense to save their most recent enrollment date in that case. 
To accomplish that, I'll add another check and I'll only add the enrollment date to the dictionary if either the 
account key was not already present, or if this enrollment date is more recent than the date that's already present. 
And I'll rerun the cell. 
Of course, that shouldn't change the number of paid students, 
it just changed what enrollment date was saved for certain students.
